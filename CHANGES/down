Anarki changes Arc 3.1's `down` loop to stop *before* the third `min` argument
rather than `after`.

For example, this loop in Arc 3.1:
    arc> (down i 10 1
           (pr i " "))
    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Behaves like this in Anarki:
    arc> (down i 10 1
           (pr i " "))
    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

A correct port to Anarki must adjust the bound:
    arc> (down i 10 0  ; <== 1 became 0
           (pr i " "))
    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
