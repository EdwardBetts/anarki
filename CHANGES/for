Anarki renames Vanilla arc 3.1's `for` loop to `up` (in symmetry with the
existing `down`) and makes `for` more C like. Type `(help for)` at the arc
prompt for more details.


Anarki's implementation of 'for' is on the form
    (for [var] [init] [test] [update] . [body])

This is a 'for' loop in vanilla arc ( from tutorial http://old.ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt )
    arc> (for i 1 10 
        (pr i " "))
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 nil

The corresponding version in Anarki would be
    arc> (for i 1 (< i 11) (= i (+ i 1))
        (pr i " "))
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1
